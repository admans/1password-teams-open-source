    "description": "We're a group of user researchers, and people who do design/user research, and we run an online community where we collaborate on the challenges of making research work inside different organisations. For example, an increasing part of this is the practice of decomposing research findings into databases of insights, called research respositories, which often take the form of adapted SaaS tools, or wordpress themes like Mosaic from Nasdaq and so on - we work out how to make these useful inside organisations, and still protect the privacy of the participants in the research, and misuse.\n\nWe run regular workshops, both in person and online, and create learning resources, and share what we know learn about embedding a sensible approach to operational security, and ethical disclosure into research practices.",
