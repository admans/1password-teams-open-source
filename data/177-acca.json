    "description": "ACCA is a fully configurable Android app that empowers users to have control over the charge cycle and it allows to proloungue the life of phone batteries. In fact several [studies](https://batteryuniversity.com/index.php/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries/) showed that Lithium-ion batteries have a longer life if partially charged.\nACCA is a frontend app for ACC, a bash script that efficiently applies user settings in the background.\nWe are in need of a password manager to keep the app signing keys and passwords, as we are publishing the app on F-droid and we plan to publish it on other stores.",
